// Changes needed in your ClerkProvider component

// Add these props to your ClerkProvider component in app/layout.tsx
// This tells Clerk to use your custom routes instead of generating its own

signInUrl="/sign-in"
signUpUrl="/sign-up"
afterSignInUrl="/dashboard"
afterSignUpUrl="/dashboard"

// Also add this configuration to let Clerk know where to find the sign-in/sign-up components
routing="path"

// Example:
<ClerkProvider
  appearance={{
    // Your existing appearance config
  }}
  // Add these four props:
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  signUpUrl="/sign-up"
  afterSignInUrl="/dashboard"
  afterSignUpUrl="/dashboard"
  routing="path"
>
  {/* Your existing layout */}
</ClerkProvider>
