Clerk Next.js App Router Configuration Checklist

1. Verify your .env.local file has the following environment variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   - CLERK_SECRET_KEY
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard

2. Make sure your authentication routes use the catch-all pattern:
   - app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
   - app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx

3. Ensure your middleware is correctly set up:
   - Using clerkMiddleware
   - Has the correct matcher patterns

4. Your ClerkProvider in app/layout.tsx should have:
   - No "routing" prop (handled by environment variables)
   - Correct appearance settings

5. Try rebuilding and restarting your development server:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

6. If issues persist, try cleaning Next.js cache:
   ```
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

These changes should fix the ClerkLoaded component error by:
1. Simplifying the landing page to not use Clerk client components
2. Using the correct route structure for auth pages
3. Removing unnecessary routing props from the SignIn/SignUp components
